# odin-library-app
A small Library app.<br/><br/>
You can see it in action on [GitHub Pages](https://skorzany.github.io/odin-library-app/).<br/>
Project made as a form of practicing <em>objects</em> and <em>object constructors</em>:<br/>each book is an object displayed as a separate card made from template.<br/><br/>
User interface allows for adding/removing books as well as <br/>manipulating their read status.<br/>
Cards are displayed in order of <em>addition</em> - most recently added books <br/>appear on top.
